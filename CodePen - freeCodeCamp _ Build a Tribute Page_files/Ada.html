Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer</div>

          <h3>Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1815</strong> - Born in England</li>
            <li><strong>1835</strong> - Married William King - later to be Earl of Lovelace</li>
            <li><strong>1838</strong> - Became Countess of Lovelace"</li>
            <li><strong>1833</strong> - Met mathematician Charles Babbage</li>        
            <li><strong>Between 1842 and 1843</strong> - Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</li>      
            <li><strong>Between 1842 and 1843</strong> - Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</li>   
			<li><strong>1852</strong> - She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.</li> 
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[71] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:</p>

<p>"[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."</p>
